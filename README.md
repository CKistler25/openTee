OpenTee Tee Times Scraper

I challenged myself to learn Playwright in a week for scraping, and iterated on an old project I started.

This project is a full-stack application that scrapes Foreup websites to retrieve a list of all available tee times for a given day. It is built using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, and Playwright for web scraping.

Features
Scrapes Foreup websites for tee times availability.
Stores the retrieved data in a PostgreSQL database.
Provides a frontend built with Vue.js to display tee times.
Uses Playwright for web scraping, ensuring accurate and reliable data extraction.
API backend powered by Spring Boot, serving as the communication layer between the frontend and database.

Tech Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Frontend: Vue.js
Database: PostgreSQL
Web Scraping: Playwright
Build Tools: Maven


Prerequisites
